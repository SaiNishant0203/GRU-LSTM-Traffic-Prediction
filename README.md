# 🚦 Traffic Volume Prediction using Deep Learning


## Overview
This project leverages **Deep Learning** to analyze and forecast traffic volume across multiple junctions using real-world time-series data.  
By combining **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **LSTM/GRU-based models**, it captures temporal traffic patterns to assist in **smart city planning** and **traffic management**.

- **Feature Engineering:** Extracts datetime components (year, month, hour, weekday)  
- **EDA & Visualization:** Uncovers seasonal and hourly traffic patterns  
- **Deep Learning Models:** Implements LSTM, GRU, and Bidirectional RNNs  
- **Model Evaluation:** Calculates RMSE and visualizes performance metrics
