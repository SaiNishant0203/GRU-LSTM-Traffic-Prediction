# GRU-Traffic-Prediction
Traffic volume prediction using deep learning. The project analyzes time-series traffic data with EDA, feature extraction, and visualization, then trains LSTM/GRU models in TensorFlow to forecast vehicle flow patterns across junctions for smart city and traffic management insights.
