# 🚦 Traffic Volume Prediction using Deep Learning


## 🌍 Overview
This project leverages **Deep Learning** to analyze and forecast traffic volume across multiple junctions using real-world time-series data.  
By combining **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **LSTM/GRU-based models**, it captures temporal traffic patterns to assist in **smart city planning** and **traffic management**.
